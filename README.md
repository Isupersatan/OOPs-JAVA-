**OOPs(Object Oriented Programmings):**
OOP is a programming style that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. Think of objects as real-world things (like a car, bank account, or student) that have:

**Properties** (data/characteristics) and **Behaviors** (actions they can perform)


->**The 4 Main Principles of OOP in Java:**

1.**Abstraction** - Showing only what's necessary

**Like a car dashboard** - you see speed and fuel level but not the complex engine parts underneat

**In Java**: Use abstract classes/interfaces to hide complex details
